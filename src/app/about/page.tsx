                    I'm a Web developer based in Montreal, Canada. I'm 
                    currently focused on growing into a full-stack
                    developer, building on my front-end strenghts while
                    deepening my knowledge of back-end technologies.

                <p>
                    Beyond Web development, I'm actively expanding my
                    skill set in Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence,
                    with the goal of building applications that are not only
                    smart and scalable, but also secure. 
                </p>

                    Another of my experience is having worked in customer service
                    and technical support, which gave me a solid foundation in
                    empathy, problem-solving, and clear communication. These skills
                    have shaped how I approach development â€” with a focus on real
                    users, practical solutions, and collaborative teamwork.
